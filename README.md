Welcome to my github!
<br>
Stay awhile, and listen...

I'm currently working on a death location tracker API for randomly generated levels in the upcoming indie game Dizzy Ballers!

Here are some of my favorite projects:
<br>
<a href="https://pcabezal.github.io/nasaPOD/">NASA Astronomy Photos of the Day</a>: Slideshow which cycles through random photos of the day from the official NASA API.
<br>
<a href="https://pcabezal.github.io/etch-a-sketch/">Sketchy Etcher</a>: In browser Etch A Sketch, complete with rainbow mode!
<br>
<a href="https://pcabezal.github.io/TOPcalculator/">Calculator</a>: Utilizing this never before seen device you can use your computer to perform basic arithmetic operations!
